# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

Goals of the analysis: <br>
1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG <br>

Q: Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? <br>
A: 

Q: Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not? <br>
A: 

Q: Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? <br>
A:
